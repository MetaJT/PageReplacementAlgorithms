# Page Replacement Algorithms

_CS540 Operating Systems: Programming Assignment #4_

_**Objective: Write a script to implement different page replacement algorithms.**_

For this assignment, I demonstrated the following page replacement algorithms in `Python`:
- `LRU` (Least Recently Used)
- `OPT` (Optimal)
- `FIFO` (First In First Out)

## How it works
- In `main.py` we call for the `PageReplacement class` to access the different page replacement algorithms.
- In `main.py` each of the algorithms are called and will display their results accordingly in the terminal. 

## Quick Start
```
Click run to execute the program in the terminal
```
