# PageReplacementAlgorithms

_CS540 Operating Systems: Programming Assignment #4_

_**Objective: Write a script to implement different page replacement algorithms.**_

For this assignment, I demonstrated the following page replacement algorithms in Python:
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Optimal
- FIFO (First In First Out)

To complete this assignment 

## How it works
- The main function calls for the `PageReplacement class` to access the different page replacement algorithms.

## Quick Start
```
Click run to run the program in the terminal
```
